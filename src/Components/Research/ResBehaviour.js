Memory is more like a jigsaw puzzle than a video player: remembering one detail helps us to fit the others in place. But, the type of information we recall and the accuracy with which we do so varies considerably between experiences and from one person to another. My doctoral research explored how memory for contextual information differs in autism. My postdoctoral research uses multimodal, naturalistic paradigms to test how we integrate and reconstruct visuospatial features of our environment, and how those features influence our subjective experience of the past.`;
